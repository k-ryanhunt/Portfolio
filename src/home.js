          As someone who has always had a passion for creativity, I have
          explored many different jobs and opportunities to try and find my
          niche. I originally started my years after high school in college
          studying Commercial Graphics, specifically Graphic Design. I was in
          love with the creative process and being able to create something
          functional yet beautiful for other people. I briefly took a hiatus
          from the design world due to personal reasons and I regretted it
          everyday. During that time, I freelanced logos for companies using
          just Microsoft PowerPoint and my passion for design. It didn’t stop
          there either. I was contracted to decorate people’s homes, redesign
          forms for my job that were more functional and aesthetically pleasing,
          and I created advertisements that are now used as an example for a
          school project.

          When I found web design, I knew it was something that I had to
          explore. Being able to create something that is functional, effective,
          and eye-catching is exactly what I had been yearning for. Once I
          started the UX/UI Design program through University of Denver, I
          finally felt like I found something that encompassed all of my
          passions into one. I have already gone on about my love for design but
          what I also love is a good challenge. I enjoy sweeping through code
          and finding what is making it break, I enjoy the trial and error
          process of trying to make certain features work, and I love patterns.
          I love patterns, repetition, and the analytical side of me also loves
          this field. During group projects, I was either managing what features
          needed to be done next, what could make the design more appealing to a
          potential client, or debugging code to figure out what was making it
          break.

        <p>
          I am typically promoted quickly within my companies or chosen to be in
          a management position. I am extremely dedicated to being efficient and
          always finding new ways to make things functional. I find creative
          solutions to workplace problems and I pick up on new skills quickly. I
          was elected President of the Dental Hygiene program that I was in,
          recognized by two separate Wells Fargo’s Regional Presidents for
          having high performance, and received recognition awards at
          Benefitfocus for my quarterly reviews.

          I may not have formal experience in UX/UI Design but I will be
          successful given the right opportunity with the right company. I have
          the desire, passion, and eye for design as I am also continuously
          researching new ideas and code languages. My goal is to work with
          clients and come up with an aesthetically pleasing and functional
          design for everyone. The victories of consistently improving and
          bettering a product or website for the user is thrilling to me.
